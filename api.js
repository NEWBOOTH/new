Guess who gets the job of stopping the now mobile missing MADOX? Poor Kouji. If he's late for his date, it's over between him and his girlfriend. His current attire redefines the term over-dressed. And to top it all off, Kilgore wants to make him late- as in the late Kouji!",

The show was created by Dan Curtis. The story bible, which was written by Art Wallace, does not mention any supernatural elements. It was unprecedented in daytime television when ghosts were introduced about six months after it began. The series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.",

However, he has a card called "Blaster Blade" that was given to him when he was little, which is the sole thing that sustains him. Then Toshiki Kai, a cool-hearted high schooler, introduces Aichi to a card game called "Vanguard". When participants battle they picture they are on a planet called "Clay", and since Vanguard features a never before seen game system it has become popular around the world. Aichi immediately likes Vanguard, so he begins to play it with his friends Misaki Togura and Kamui Katsuragi, and others like his new rival Kai (who is one of the best Vanguard players). Aichi plays every day and he strives with all his soul and heart to play better, so when he battles Kai, Kai will recognize Aichi's worth.`,

"overview": "Triangle was a BBC Television soap opera in the early 1980s, set aboard a North Sea ferry which sailed from Felixstowe to Gothenburg and Gothenburg to Amsterdam. A third imaginary leg existed between Amsterdam and Felixstowe to justify the programme title, but this was not operated by the ferry company. The show ran for three series before being cancelled, but is still generally remembered as some of the most mockable British television ever produced. The scripts involved clichéd relationships and stilted dialogue, making the show the butt of several jokes - particularly on Terry Wogan's morning Radio 2 programme - which caused some embarrassment to the BBC. In 1992, the BBC screened TV Hell, an evening of programming devoted to the worst television had to offer, and the first episode of Triangle was broadcast as part of the line-up. The ferry used in the first series was the Tor Line's MS Tor Scandinavia. In the second and third series this was replaced by the DFDS vessel Dana Anglia probably because she had a less intensive schedule and the longer time she spent in port made on-board filming easier.",

          "overview": `"The Colbert Report is an American satirical late night television program that airs Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot", is a caricature of televised political pundits. The Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term "truthiness", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year."`,

A total of 1330 episodes were produced, making it the second-longest-running series in Hong Kong, after "Come Home Love: Lo and Behold". Each episode of this series is inspired by current social issues, with early storylines often satirizing societys flaws. The characters, such as "Chen Ji," "Mrs. Shun," "Uncle Mao," "Jue Wu Yin," "Miss Su," "A Wei," and "Ah Kang," mostly hail from the grassroots, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. For example, "Mrs. Shun," portrayed by Lydia Shum, later became a term to describe uneducated women who follow trends blindly. "Chen Ji," played by Lawrence Ng, is a stockbroker who loves to show off his wealth, and his behavior typified that of many Hong Kongers, becoming a byword for the citys nouveau riche.',

Watson gives Holmes boxing lessons. Watson himself is an experienced boxer, able to deal with several opponents with his bare hands. In addition, he is an excellent marksman. Considering Holmes a genius, the doctor decides to tell the whole world about his talent and the mysteries he revealed in his stories, where he often embellishes the events («the true story» of which the series presents). Watson is taught to embellish events by the editor-in-chief of the «Morning Chronicle».",

          "overview": "This sitcom series premiered in 1981 and changed its name every year, from Hong Kong 81 to Hong Kong 86. It was eventually replaced by a new sitcom called City Stories. A total of 1330 episodes were produced, making it the second-longest-running series in Hong Kong, after Come Home Love: Lo and Behold. Each episode of this series is inspired by current social issues, with early storylines often satirizing society's flaws. The characters, such as Chen Ji, Mrs. Shun, Uncle Mao, Jue Wu Yin, Miss Su, A Wei, and Ah Kang, mostly hail from the grassroots, leaving a lasting impression on the audience. For example, Mrs. Shun, portrayed by Lydia Shum, later became a term to describe uneducated women who follow trends blindly. Chen Ji, played by Lawrence Ng, is a stockbroker who loves to show off his wealth, and his behavior typified that of many Hong Kongers, becoming a byword for the city's nouveau riche.",

After emerging as the sole survivor of an especially bloody skirmish, Ahn Jung-geun heads an operation to assassinate Itō Hirobumi, the first Japanese Resident-General of Korea and a key symbol of violent colonial oppression.

With terrifying risks at every turn, murderous security forces on their tail, and the entire plan under constant threat of collapse, the question arises: how many Koreans must die for the sake of their country’s independence?",

Then one day, opportunity finds her but it's an erotic film... She is Sky Girl h Soo-jin. Seven years ago, Oh Soo-jin made a movie called Sky Girl which resulted in only 20,000 views. She ground her teeth to recover from her failure by making a second movie. One day she gets a call from Park, a gangster and movie director who asks her to make a porn movie with him. The actress of the movie is an AV girl from Japan. Oh Soo-jin denies the offer and returns home but all that's waiting for her are unpaid rent and bills. Oh Soo-jin calls Park after watching the AV girl's porn and suggests she turns the whole set into a women-only production. She has a week to film the movie with 100 million won. Can she do it?",

While her brother trains to take his place in the court, Yoon-jeong helps him out by secretly painting for him. The little girl’s life is turned upside down when her brother kills himself.

For the first time, she feels the strong desire to abandon everything she has built and simply be a woman in front of the man she loves. Kang-moo sacrifices all for his love as well.",
